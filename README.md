# Unsupervised-Data-Augmentation-For-Consistency-Training
PyTorch implementation of the computer vision related part of the paper "Unsupervised Data Augmentation for Consistency Training".

To run the training script: ``` python augm_data.py  ``` .
To see training progression, run tensorboard: ``` tensorboard --logdir path/to/saved/logs ```
